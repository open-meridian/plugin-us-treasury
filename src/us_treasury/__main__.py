"""The US Treasury's daily interest rates as an Open Meridian data plugin
(spec/a-public-rates-and-filings-data-plugin, `plugin-us-treasury`; one
plugin per publisher's feed, rulings 343 to 349): the par yield curve, the
real par yield curve and the bill rates of each business day into the
deployment's lake, as rates, each curve one referential record and its
points rows.

It connects to the sidecar it is launched beside with its catalogue, its
storage and its one setting (declaration.py), serves its two pages
(page.py), hears what the lake wants of it, reads Treasury's current months
at start and every hour, recording what changed, and reads back each
curve's history on its first run (feed.py). What Treasury answered is kept
in the storage the deployment grants (raw.py), and moved past its window as
the settings say. It reads which of its datasets a deployment admin has
licensed, on start and every minute, and reports the data role's figures on
its heartbeat. It holds nothing else: a restart reads Treasury again, and
the lake answers what it recorded before unchanged.

Everything it says to the deployment goes through the sidecar; everything it
reads comes from Treasury's public site, or with sample data from the
answers committed with it.
